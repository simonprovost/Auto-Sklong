# üì∞ Latest News 

- **Bye Bye PDM!**: We are now leveraging 
  [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) from **Astral** (alongside Ruff)!

- **Documentation**: For a deep dive into `Auto-Sklong`, check out our 
  [official docs](https://simonprovost.github.io/Auto-Sklong/).

- **PyPi**: The library's latest version is published on [PyPi here](https://pypi.org/project/Auto-Sklong/).


## <a id="about-the-project"></a>üí° About The Project

`Auto-Scikit-Longitudinal`, also called `Auto-Sklong` is an automated machine learning (AutoML) library designed to analyse
longitudinal data (Classification tasks focussed as of today) using various search methods. Namely,
`Bayesian Optimisation` via [SMAC3](https://github.com/automl/SMAC3), `Asynchronous Successive Halving`, 
`Evolutionary Algorithms`, and `Random Search` 
via [the General Automated Machine Learning Assistant (GAMA)](https://github.com/openml-labs/gama).

`Auto-Sklong` built upon `GAMA`, offers a brand-new search space to tackle the Longitudinal Machine Learning classification problems,
with a user-friendly interface, similar to the popular `Scikit` paradigm.

Please for further information, visit the [official documentation](https://simonprovost.github.io/scikit-longitudinal/).

## <a id="installation"></a>üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To install `Auto-Sklong`, take these two easy steps:

1. ‚úÖ **Install the latest version of `Auto-Sklong`**:

```shell
pip install Auto-Sklong
```
You could also install different versions of the library by specifying the version number, 
e.g. `pip install Auto-Sklong==0.0.1`. 
Refer to [Release Notes](https://github.com/simonprovost/auto-sklong/releases)

2. üì¶ **[MANDATORY] Update the required dependencies (Why? See [here](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1316#issuecomment-2106457708))**

`Auto-Sklong` incorporates via `Sklong` a modified version of `Scikit-Learn` called `Scikit-Lexicographical-Trees`, 
which can be found at [this Pypi link](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-lexicographical-trees/).

This revised version guarantees compatibility with the unique features of `Scikit-longitudinal`. 
Nevertheless, conflicts may occur with other dependencies in `Auto-Sklong` that also require `Scikit-Learn`. 
Follow these steps to prevent any issues when running your project.

<details>
<summary><strong>ü´µ Simple Setup: Command Line Installation</strong></summary>

Say you want to try `Auto-Sklong` in a very simple environment. Such as without a proper `project.toml` file (`Poetry`, `PDM`, etc).
Run the following command:

```shell
pip uninstall scikit-learn scikit-lexicographical-trees && pip install scikit-lexicographical-trees
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>ü´µ Project Setup: Using `UV`</strong></summary>

Imagine you are managing your project with **UV**, a powerful and flexible project management tool. Below is an example configuration for integrating **UV** in your `pyproject.toml` file.

To ensure smooth operation and avoid dependency conflicts, you can override specific dependencies like `Scikit-Learn`. Add the following configuration to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv]
package = true
override-dependencies = [
    "scikit-learn ; sys_platform == 'never'",
]
```

This setup ensures that UV will manage your project‚Äôs dependencies efficiently, while avoiding conflicts with Scikit-Learn.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>ü´µ Project Setup: Using `PDM`</strong></summary>

Imagine you have a project being managed by `PDM`, or any other package manager. The example below demonstrates `PDM`. 
Nevertheless, the process is similar for `Poetry`.

Therefore, to prevent dependency conflicts, you can exclude `Scikit-Learn` by adding the provided configuration 
to your `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
[tool.pdm.resolution]
excludes = ["scikit-learn"]
```

*This exclusion ensures Scikit-Lexicographical-Trees (used as `Scikit-learn`) is used seamlessly within your project.*

### üöÄ **What's New Compared to GAMA?**

We enhanced [@PGijsbers'](https://github.com/PGijsbers) open-source `GAMA` initiative by introducing a brand-new search space designed specifically for tackling longitudinal classification problems. This search space is powered by our custom library, [`Scikit-Longitudinal` (Sklong)](https://github.com/simonprovost/scikit-longitudinal), enabling Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH Optimization).

Unlike `GAMA` or other existing AutoML libraries, `Auto-Sklong` offers out-of-the-box support for 
longitudinal classification tasks‚Äîa capability not previously available. 

#### Search Space Viz.:
To better understand our proposed search space, refer to the visualisation below (read from left to right, each step being one new component to a final pipeline candidate configuration):

[![Search Space Visualization](https://i.imgur.com/advUOnU.png)](https://i.imgur.com/advUOnU.png)

While `GAMA` offers some configurability for search spaces, we improved its functionality to better suit our needs. You can find the details of our contributions in the following pull requests:
- [ConfigSpace Technology Integration for Enhanced GAMA Configuration and Management ü•á](https://github.com/openml-labs/gama/pull/210)
- [Search Methods Enhancements to Avoid Duplicate Evaluated Pipelines ü•à](https://github.com/openml-labs/gama/pull/211)
- [SMAC3 Bayesian Optimisation Integration üÜï](https://github.com/openml-labs/gama/pull/212)

### üíª Developer Notes

For developers looking to contribute, please refer to the `Contributing` section of `GAMA` [here](https://openml-labs.github.io/gama/master/contributing/index.html)
and `Scikit-Longitudinal` [here](https://simonprovost.github.io/scikit-longitudinal/contribution/).

## <a id="Supported-Operating-Systems"></a>üõ†Ô∏è Supported Operating Systems

`Auto-Sklong` is compatible with the following operating systems:

- MacOS Ô£ø _(Careful, you may need to force your settings to be under intel x86_64 and not apple silicon if you hold an M-based chip)_
- Linux üêß
- On Windows ü™ü, you are recommended to run the library within a Docker container under a Linux distribution.

## <a id="how-to-use"></a></a>üöÄ Getting Started

To perform AutoML on your longitudinal analysis with `Auto-Sklong`, use the following two-easy-steps.

- First, load and prepare  your dataset using the `LongitudinalDataset` class of 
[`Sklong`](https://simonprovost.github.io/scikit-longitudinal/).

- Second, use the `GamaLongitudinalClassifier` class of `Auto-Sklong`. 
Following instantiating it set up its `hyperparameters` or let default, you can apply the popular 
_fit_, _predict_, _prodict_proba_, methods in the same way that `Scikit-learn` 
does, as shown in the example below. It will then automatically search for the best model and hyperparameters for your dataset.

_Refer to the documentation for more information on the `GamaLongitudinalClassifier` class._

``` py
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from scikit_longitudinal.data_preparation import LongitudinalDataset
from gama.GamaLongitudinalClassifier import GamaLongitudinalClassifier

# Load your longitudinal dataset
dataset = LongitudinalDataset('./stroke.csv')
dataset.load_data_target_train_test_split(
  target_column="class_stroke_wave_4",
)

# Pre-set or manually set your temporal dependencies 
dataset.setup_features_group(input_data="elsa")

# Instantiate the AutoML system
automl = GamaLongitudinalClassifier(
    features_group=dataset.features_group(),
    non_longitudinal_features=dataset.non_longitudinal_features(),
    feature_list_names=dataset.data.columns.tolist(),
)

# Run the AutoML system to find the best model and hyperparameters
model.fit(dataset.X_train, dataset.y_train)

# Predictions and prediction probabilities
label_predictions = automl.predict(X_test)
probability_predictions = automl.predict_proba(X_test)

# Classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, label_predictions))

# Export a reproducible script of the champion model
automl.export_script() 
```
